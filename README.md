Introduction
A software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a list of all the open source and third-party components present in a codebase. An SBOM also lists the licenses that govern those components, the versions of the components used in the codebase, and their patch status, which allows security teams to quickly identify any associated security or license risks.

The concept of a software Bill of Materials derives from manufacturing, where a Bill of Materials is an inventory detailing all the items included in a product. In the automotive industry, for example, manufacturers maintain a detailed Bill of Materials for each vehicle. This BOM lists the parts built by the original equipment manufacturer itself and the parts from third-party suppliers. When a defective part is discovered, the auto manufacturer knows precisely which vehicles are affected and can notify vehicle owners of the need for repair or replacement.

Similarly, smart organizations that build software maintain an accurate, up-to-date software Bill of Materials that includes an inventory of third-party and open source components to ensure their code is high-quality, compliant, and secure.
